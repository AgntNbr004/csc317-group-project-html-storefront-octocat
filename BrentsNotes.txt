BRENT'S UNNECESSARY NOTES:
--------------------------

Just in case you guys aren't doing this, this needs to be in this folder to work:
	/var/www/html

To get to this directory:
	1. Open up a File Explorer window
	2. Other Locations -> Computer -> var -> www -> html

Once these files are there, you can see the site by opening FireFox and going to:
	localhost/index.php

You guys will have to transition to PHP and MySQL to see items stored in a database.
I strongly suggest you guys get DataGrip for the MySQL part, it's free.
Go download it, install it, then:
	1. Create a new super user:
		username: "brent"
		password: "Student123!"
	2. Create a database schema "Octocat"
	3. Load the sql scripts and run them in this order:
		create_tables
		reference_tables
		sample_data



--------------------------------------
THINGS WE SHOULD DO BEFORE TURNING IN:
--------------------------------------
	01. Settings should not show up until user is logged in.
	    PHP SESSIONS
	02. Settings should be populated with user info from database.
	    PHP +  DATABASE
	03. Website "Theme" should be stored in DB and pulled from DB 
	    PHP +  DATABASE
	04. "Salt" the username / password to increase security
	    PHP +  DATABASE
	05. Allow Settings to update database
	    PHP +  DATABASE
	06. login.php "Password Reset" link does nothing.
	07. Newsletter from footer should set flag / generate alert
	    PHP +  DATABASE
	08. Create banner for "Account Registration"
BR->	09. Allow for account registration to log information to the database /
	    generate alerts if needed (eg. username already exists).
	10. Account Registration page has a "Terms of Use" and a "Privacy Policy"
	    both of which do nothing. Find some basic lorem ipsum to fill in.
	11. Find a way to display order history to customer
	    PHP + DATABASE
