Brent's unnecessary notes:

Just in case you guys aren't doing this, this needs to be in this folder to work:
	/var/www/html

To get to this directory:
	1. Open up a File Explorer window
	2. Other Locations -> Computer -> var -> www -> html

Once these files are there, you can see the site by opening FireFox and going to:
	localhost/index.php
